// Description
// This library allows you to communicate with SPI devices, 
// with the Arduino as the controller device. 
// This library is bundled with every Arduino platform (avr, megaavr, mbed, samd, sam, arc32), 
// so you do not need to install the library separately.
// To use this library
// #include <SPI.h>
// To read more about Arduino and SPI, you can visit the Arduino & Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) guide.
