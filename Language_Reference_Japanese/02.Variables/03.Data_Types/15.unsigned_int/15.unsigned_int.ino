// Description
// On the Uno and other ATMEGA based boards, unsigned ints (unsigned integers) 
// are the same as ints in that they store a 2 byte value. 
// Instead of storing negative numbers however they only store positive values, 
// yielding a useful range of 0 to 65,535 ((2^16) - 1).
// 
// The Due stores a 4 byte (32-bit) value, ranging from 0 to 4,294,967,295 (2^32 - 1).
// 
// The difference between unsigned ints and (signed) ints, lies in the way the highest bit, 
// sometimes referred to as the "sign" bit, is interpreted. 
// In the Arduino int type (which is signed), if the high bit is a "1", 
// the number is interpreted as a negative number, 
// and the other 15 bits are interpreted with (2’s complement math).
// 
// Syntax
// unsigned int var = val;
// 
// Parameters
// var: variable name.
// val: the value you assign to that variable.
// 
// Example Code
// unsigned int ledPin = 13;
// Notes and Warnings
// When unsigned variables are made to exceed their maximum capacity they "roll over" back to 0, and also the other way around:
// 
// unsigned int x;
// x = 0;
// x = x - 1;  // x now contains 65535 - rolls over in neg direction
// x = x + 1;  // x now contains 0 - rolls over
// Math with unsigned variables may produce unexpected results, even if your unsigned variable never rolls over.
// The MCU applies the following rules:
// The calculation is done in the scope of the destination variable. 
// E.g. if the destination variable is signed, it will do signed math, 
// even if both input variables are unsigned.
// However with a calculation which requires an intermediate result, 
// the scope of the intermediate result is unspecified by the code. 
// In this case, the MCU will do unsigned math for the intermediate result, because both inputs are unsigned!

unsigned int x = 5;
unsigned int y = 10;
int result;

result = x - y; // 5 - 10 = -5, as expected
result = (x - y) / 2; // 5 - 10 in unsigned math is 65530!  65530/2 = 32765

// solution: use signed variables, or do the calculation step by step.
result = x - y; // 5 - 10 = -5, as expected
result = result / 2;  //  -5/2 = -2 (only integer math, decimal places are dropped)

// Why use unsigned variables at all?
// The rollover behaviour is desired, e.g. counters
// The signed variable is a bit too small, but you want to avoid the memory and speed loss of long/float.
