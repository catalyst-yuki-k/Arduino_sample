// Description
// A data type used to store a character value. 
// Character literals are written in single quotes, 
// like this: 'A' (for multiple characters - strings - use double quotes: "ABC").
// Characters are stored as numbers however. You can see the specific encoding in the ASCII chart. 
// This means that it is possible to do arithmetic on characters, 
// in which the ASCII value of the character is used 
// (e.g. 'A' + 1 has the value 66, since the ASCII value of the capital letter A is 65). 
// See Serial.println reference for more on how characters are translated to numbers.
// The size of the char datatype is at least 8 bits. 
// It’s recommended to only use char for storing characters. 
// For an unsigned, one-byte (8 bit) data type, use the byte data type.
// Syntax
// char var = val;
// Parameters
// var: variable name.
// val: the value to assign to that variable.
// Example Code
// char myChar = 'A';
// char myChar = 65; // both are equivalent
