// Description
// Logical NOT results in a true if the operand is false and vice versa.
// 
// Example Code
// This operator can be used inside the condition of an if statement.
if (!x) { // if x is not true
  // statements
}
// It can be used to invert the boolean value.
/*
x = !y; // the inverted value of y is stored in x
*/
// Notes and Warnings
// The bitwise not ~ (tilde) looks much different than the boolean not ! 
// (exclamation point or "bang" as the programmers say) 
// but you still have to be sure which one you want where.
