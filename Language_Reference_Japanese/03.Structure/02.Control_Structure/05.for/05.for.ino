// Description
// The for statement is used to repeat a block of statements enclosed in curly braces. 
// An increment counter is usually used to increment and terminate the loop. 
// The for statement is useful for any repetitive operation, 
// and is often used in combination with arrays to operate on collections of data/pins.
// 
// Syntax
// for (initialization; condition; increment) {
  // statement(s);
// }
// Parameters
// initialization: happens first and exactly once.
// condition: each time through the loop, condition is tested; if it’s true, the statement block, 
// and the increment is executed, then the condition is tested again. 
// When the condition becomes false, the loop ends.
// increment: executed each time through the loop when condition is true.
// 
// Example Code
// Dim an LED using a PWM pin
int PWMpin = 10;  // LED in series with 470 ohm resistor on pin 10

void setup() {
  // no setup needed
}

void loop() {
  for (int i = 0; i <= 255; i++) {
    analogWrite(PWMpin, i);
    delay(10);
  }
}

// Notes and Warnings
// The C++ for loop is much more flexible than for loops found in some other computer languages, 
// including BASIC. Any or all of the three header elements may be omitted, 
// although the semicolons are required. 
// Also the statements for initialization, condition, and increment can be any valid C++ statements with unrelated variables, 
// and use any C++ datatypes including floats. 
// These types of unusual for statements may provide solutions to some rare programming problems.
// 
// For example, using a multiplication in the increment line will generate a logarithmic progression:
// 
/*
for (int x = 2; x < 100; x = x * 1.5) {
    println(x);
}
*/
// Generates: 2,3,4,6,9,13,19,28,42,63,94
// 
// Another example, fade an LED up and down with one for loop:
// 
/*
void loop() {
    int x = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i > -1; i = i + x) {
        analogWrite(PWMpin, i);
        if (i == 255) {
            x = -1;  // switch direction at peak
        }
        delay(10);
    }
}
