// Description
// Comments are lines in the program that are used to inform yourself or others about the way the program works. 
// They are ignored by the compiler, and not exported to the processor, 
// so they don’t take up any space in the microcontroller’s flash memory. 
// Comments' only purpose is to help you understand (or remember), 
// or to inform others about how your program works.
// 
// A single line comment begins with // (two adjacent slashes). 
// This comment ends automatically at the end of a line. Whatever follows // till the end of a line will be ignored by the compiler.
// 
// Example Code
// There are two different ways of marking a line as a comment:
// 
// pin 13 has an LED connected on most Arduino boards.
// give it a name:
int led = 13;
digitalWrite(led, HIGH);  // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)

// Notes and Warnings
// When experimenting with code, "commenting out" parts of your program is a convenient way to remove lines that may be buggy. 
// This leaves the lines in the code, but turns them into comments, so the compiler just ignores them. 
// This can be especially useful when trying to locate a problem, 
// or when a program refuses to compile and the compiler error is cryptic or unhelpful.
